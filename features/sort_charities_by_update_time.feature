Feature: Order organizations by most recently updated
  As any user
  So that I can see which charities have been updated most recently
  I want to be able to sort charities by update time
  Tracker story ID: 50082619

Background: organizations have been added to database
  
  Given the following organizations exist:
  | name                            | updated_at | address |
  | Harrow Bereavement Counselling  | "2013-01-23 15:54:34" | 34 pinner road |
  | Indian Elders Association       | "2013-02-23 15:54:34" | 64 pinner road |
  | Age UK                          | "2013-03-23 15:54:34" | 84 pinner road |

  Scenario: Most recently updated charity shows at the top of the list 
  Given I update the "Indian Elders Association" 
  And I am on the home page
  Then I should see "Indian Elders Association" before "Age UK"
  And I should see "Age UK" before "Harrow Bereavement Counselling"
