Feature: Password retrieval
 As an existing User
 So that I can recover a lost password
 I want to be able to ask that system for a new password

#Scenario: Retrieve password for an existing user
#  Given PENDING: I am on the sign in page
#  When I follow the Forgot your password
#  And I fill email with jcodefx@gmail.com
#  Then I should see "password sent"
  
#Scenario: Retrieve password for a non-existent user

#  And I should see "I'm sorry, your email is not registered in our system"
