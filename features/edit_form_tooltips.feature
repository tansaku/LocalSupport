  Scenario: Display tooltip for each label on the edit form
    Given I am signed in as a charity worker related to "Harrow Bereavement Counselling"
    And I am on the edit charity page for "Harrow Bereavement Counselling"
    #Then I should see "Name" < tagged > with "first tooltip"
    Then the "Name" label should display "Enter a unique name" as a tooltip
    Then the following tooltips should exist: 
      | label         | tooltip        | 
      | Name          | Enter a unique name |
      |  Address  |  Enter a complete address  |
